    <h3>How to play?</h3>
        <p>
            In blackjack, the objective is to beat the dealer by having a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Each card has a point value, with numbered cards worth their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) valued at 10 points each, and Aces worth either 1 or 11 points. At the start, You will receive two cards. Even the dealer will receive cards. Players can see their cards, but one of the dealer's cards will be hidden. Players then decide whether to "hit" (take another card) to improve their hand or "stand" to keep their current total. The goal is to achieve a hand closer to 21 than the dealer's without going over. If a player's hand exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose the round. The dealer follows a set of rules, usually hitting until they reach at least 17. The player with a hand closest to 21 without busting wins the round.
